# User Centric FrontEnd Development Milestone Project

# Yoga Studio Website
## Website Overview
The purpose of this project is to design a static website for a yoga studio located in the city. The website provides an online presence to the yoga studio and allow customers and potential customers to browse their services and purchase yoga package from this website.

## UX
This website serves to provide yoga services targeting workers in the local business and financial district and also the general public. Presumably workers are tired and stressed out after a long day at work or even during work and this website serve to inform them of the fitness services provided to them, utilizing the location convenience of the yoga studio.

The design should be user friendly, simple and easy on the eyes. Users of this website should be able to gain information about the yoga studio, the services and the pricing offered. The possible User stories are as follows:

*User Story 1: The user is an office worker or general public and wants to find yoga studio in the vicinity that he/she can go to, and wants to know the class timing offered in the yoga studio to be able to fit it into his/her personal schedule. 
*User Story 2: The user wants to find what yoga classes suits him/her based on their needs. For example, classes that target fitness or mind-relaxation.
*User Story 3: The user is a pregnant office worker and would like to work-out pre-partum. She wants to know which studio offers prenatal yoga.
*User Story 4: The user/s is/are high income customers who wants personalized yoga classes.
*User Story 6: An organization wants to organize a yoga workout for its staff members and wants a yoga studio in the vicinity.

Based on the user stories, the website was designed with the following sections:
*Home - Landing page with pictures of person/people doing yoga
*Articles - Links to online article to list the benefits or trends of yoga
*Service Types - Breakdown of class-types by needs and links to schedule
*Pricing - Pricing packages on offer

I've chosen to use a light beige/ brown theme throughout the whole site to reflect on the earthiness of yoga. For selective highlighting (buttons/price cards), I've chosen to use a touch of pink to bring out the attention to the users. 

I chose to use Ubuntu (sans-serif) font for heading because of its modern, easy to read look. The spacing between letters are appropriately spaced for a clean look. In a similar context, I chose to use Lora(serif) font for the content because it is modern and clean and pairs perfectly with the Ubuntu headings.
