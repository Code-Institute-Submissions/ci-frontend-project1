# User Centric FrontEnd Development Milestone Project

# Yoga Studio Website
## Website Overview
The purpose of this project is to design a static website for a yoga studio located in the city. The website provides an online presence to the yoga studio and allow customers and potential customers to browse their services and purchase yoga package from this website.

## UX
This website serves to provide yoga services targeting workers in the local business and financial district and also the general public. Presumably workers are tired and stressed out after a long day at work or even during work and this website serve to inform them of the fitness services provided to them, utilizing the location convenience of the yoga studio.

The design should be user friendly, simple and easy on the eyes. Users of this website should be able to gain information about the yoga studio, the services and the pricing offered. The possible User stories are as follows:

* User Story 1: The user is an office worker or general public and wants to find yoga studio in the vicinity that he/she can go to, and wants to know the class timing offered in the yoga studio to be able to fit it into his/her personal schedule. 
* User Story 2: The user wants to find what yoga classes suits him/her based on their needs. For example, classes that target fitness or mind-relaxation.
* User Story 3: The user is a pregnant office worker and would like to work-out pre-partum. She wants to know which studio offers prenatal yoga.
* User Story 4: The user/s is/are high income customers who wants personalized yoga classes.
* User Story 6: An organization wants to organize a yoga workout for its staff members and wants a yoga studio in the vicinity.

Based on the user stories, the website was designed with the following sections:
* Home - Landing page with pictures of person/people doing yoga
* Articles - Links to online article to list the benefits or trends of yoga
* Service Types - Breakdown of class-types by needs and links to schedule
* Pricing - Pricing packages on offer

I've chosen to use a light beige/ brown theme throughout the whole site to reflect on the earthiness of yoga. For selective highlighting (buttons/price cards), I've chosen to use a touch of pink to bring out the attention to the users. 

I chose to use Ubuntu (sans-serif) font for heading because of its modern, easy to read look. The spacing between letters are appropriately spaced for a clean look. In a similar context, I used Lora(serif) font for the content because it is modern and clean and pairs perfectly with the Ubuntu headings.

## Features 
### Existing Features
In the main page, this project has 4 sections: 
1. The Home Page consists of a carousel of people doing yoga poses. The purpose is to motivate users to want to do yoga as well either for relaxation of the mind or for sculpting their physique. At the 3rd carousel image, there is a call to action button to lead users to view the class-type offered.
1a. The Home Page has a nav bar that has a menu to allow users to find which part of the site they would like to visit next. In the nav bar, the menu item contact has a drop-down link to phone call, e-mail, location and query. The phone call icon will allow users to open a phone dialer and input the number. The e-mail icon will allow users to open up an e-mail app to send e-mail and the location icon will open a pop-up window to show the studio location on an embedded google map.
2. The second section consists of linked articles to inform users of the benefits of yoga exercises. Users are able to read through the article by clicking on the cards. 
3. The third section consists of flip cards. The features on this page are flip cards. It serves to summarize in 1-2 words what the users are looking for in doing yoga. For example, if the user wish to improve his/her fitness, he/she will flip over the fitness card to find which yoga class type is suitable for improving his/her fitness level and at the back of the flip-card, users are able to click the button that will allow them to view the class schedules or the button to purchase a class package.
4. The final section consists of pricing cards or tables. The features on this page are cards which are similar to the second section. It serves to inform users of the different class packages and the list of items/services that comes with the purchase.
The user may purchase the package or services by clicking on the purchase buttons of the pricing tables.
4a. The footer section has the e-mail address, the phone number, the location and links to feedback form displayed. It also has links to social media sites. The user is able to click on the icons to contact or be contacted as well as to visit the social media sites.

Off the main page, the Contact drop down in the menu has a Queries item that will link to a form page. This page only has 1 secion. The main feature of this page is a form which allows user to fill in his/her name, phone number, e-mail address and their preference of day and time to be contacted. There is also a input text box to allow users to put down their queries or comments.

### Features To Be Implemented In Future
One item that I would like to implement in the future is an about page that talks about the yoga studio, the mission and the vision of the business.

### Features Left to be Implemented
This project lacks pop-up/modal sign-up form when users click the purchase button. Another feature to add is the billing page for users to add the packages to cart and input their credit-card information. 

## Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project are:
* HTML5 (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/). HTML5 is the markup language that stores the structure of the webpage document.
* CSS3 (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/). CSS3 is used to style the contents, images and layouts of HTML documents.
* Boostrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/). Boostrap 4 is used as an additional framework tool for making structuring of the project easier and a lot faster. It has build in classes to allow me to style my layouts fast as well as making mobile-responsive design easier.
* GoogleFonts (https://fonts.google.com/). I use google fonts to style the texts in this project.
* Font Awesome Icons(https://fontawesome.com/). I use font awesome icons to add icons to certain part of the contents in this project for simplicity and readability.
